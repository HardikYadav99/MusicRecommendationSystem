# Music Recommender System Readme

## Overview

This Music Recommender System is a Python application that provides personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening history. It offers two user interfaces for your convenience: one for Google Colab and one for local hosting on your machine.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts and log in to the system.

- **Music Data**: The system uses a dataset of songs and their attributes (e.g., genre, artist, tempo) to make recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: Users receive personalized music recommendations based on their listening history and preferences.

- **User Interaction**: Users can rate songs, save favorites, and skip songs, which helps improve recommendation accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this Music Recommender System, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

- Jupyter Notebook if you prefer using Google Colab.

- Visual Studio Code or any other code editor of your choice.

- Required Python libraries, which can be installed using `pip` or `conda`. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file included with this project.

## Getting Started

2. **Music Recommendations**: Start exploring personalized music recommendations based on your listening history and preferences.

3. **Interact with Music**: Rate songs, save favorites, and skip songs to improve the recommendations further.

4. **Log Out**: Don't forget to log out when you're done using the application to keep your data secure.
